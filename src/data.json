It was designed for the chasers, the racers and the pacers who can't resist the thrill of the chase. We've redesigned the flagship Supershoe Backpack and optimized the engine underneath to help you achieve personal bests from the 10-meter dash to the marathon. This versatile road running workhorse is for anyone who sees speed as the gateway to more miles and seemingly unattainable heights, from elite runners to new runners.",
